# Setting Up Google Gemini API Key

To get started with Google Gemini API, you'll need to generate an API key. Follow the steps below to create the key and secure it for your project.

### 1. **Obtain the API Key**

To generate a Google Gemini API key, follow the official guide from Merge Dev. You can access the instructions here: [Google Gemini API Key Documentation](https://www.merge.dev/blog/gemini-api-key).

This documentation will walk you through the process of creating and managing your API key.

### Restrict API Key (Optional but recommended)

- After copying the API key, you can click **Restrict Key** to limit its usage.
- You can restrict the API key to specific IP addresses, referrers, or HTTP methods to secure your API key further.

### Install Dependencies in Your Project

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed in your project.


## Features in Detail

### Voice Input

The chatbot integrates speech recognition for voice-to-text input:

- Click the microphone icon to start recording
- Speak your message
- Click the microphone icon again to stop recording

### ‚ö†Ô∏èFile Attachments

Users can attach files to their messages:

- Click the attachment icon
- Select a file from their device
- The file send by the user get the correct response based on your model you are using
- Files are sent as base64-encoded data to the API
- Although the **gemini-1.5-flash** model is intended to support images, users may face issues with image processing. If you're uploading an image, be prepared for potential errors. For PDFs, the model works as expected without issues.
- **PDFs**: Works flawlessly. The model can extract and analyze text, metadata, and other content from PDF files.
- **Images**: Currently, images may result in an error when uploaded due to limitations in the model. While the **gemini-1.5-flash** model is intended to handle images, users may encounter issues with image uploads.

### Emoji Picker

The chatbot includes an emoji picker:

- Click the emoji icon to open the picker
- Select an emoji to insert it into the message

### Markdown Support

The chatbot renders messages with Markdown support:

- Format text with bold, italic, lists, etc.
- API responses can include formatted text
- Code blocks are properly displayed with syntax highlighting

## Styling

The component uses MUI (Material-UI) and Emotion for styling with:

- Smooth animations for messages and UI elements
- Gradient backgrounds
- Customizable avatars
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Dependencies

The package relies on the following dependencies:

- React
- Material-UI (MUI)
- Emotion (for styled components)
- emoji-picker-react
- react-markdown

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**This package is not production-ready yet. The current implementation exposes your Google Gemini API key in the frontend, which is not secure for production environments. Please do not use this in production unless the key is properly secured (e.g., through a proxy or server-side authentication).**

**In the current version, the API key is passed directly to the frontend, which makes it vulnerable to misuse. A secure solution will be implemented in future versions.**

## Browser Compatibility

The voice input feature uses the Web Speech API, which may not be supported in all browsers. The component gracefully handles this by disabling the feature when not supported.
